   <h1>My favourite class is Maths </h1>
    <p>Maths is my favourite class because the problems are easy to solve and i learn new things in that,example:Integers,etc.
        and my Maths teacher is very nice.
        And my favourite thing to do in maths is solve problems,more of division and multiplication.
